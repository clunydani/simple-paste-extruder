simple-paste-extruder
=====================

Simple paste extruder is a minimalistic extruder for 3D printing. Because of the "direct drive" 
design it only use very few non printed part that are widely available mainly:

* A syringe, the one we took has an external diameter of 32mm. I used a kitchen craft injector (reorder code KCINJ) http://www.ukironmonger.com/food_injector for about 5 euro.
* M8 Bolt (80 mm long)  1.6 Euro
* M8 Nut
* Stepper motor of type 28BYJ-48 + driver (about 5 euro http://www.vanallesenmeer.nl/5v-stappenmotor-met-ULN2003-driver- )

The code uses the MCAD library containing LGPL code it also used 
the Rack and pinion gears. that part of the code is GPL
